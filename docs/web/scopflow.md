## Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPFLOW)
SCOPFLOW solves a contingency-constrained optimal power flow problem. The problem is set up as a two-stage optimization problem where the first-stage (base-case) represents the normal operation of the grid and the second-stage comprises of $N_c$ contingency scenarios. Compactly, the problem can be set up in the following form:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{min}&~\sum_{i \in \{0,N_c\}}f_i(x_i)& \\
&\text{s.t.}& \\
&~g_i(x_i) = 0~~~i \in \{0,N_c\}& \\
&~h_i(x_i) \le 0~~i \in \{0,N_c\}& \\
&x^- \le x_i \le x^+~~i\in \{0,N_c\}& \\
-\delta{x} & \le x_i - x_0 \le \delta{x}~~i \in \{1,N_c\}&
\end{aligned}
 ```

where $N_c$ is the number of contingencies. The total number of scenarios equals $N_c + 1$, i.e., base-case + $N_c$ contingencies. Each scenario is an optimal power flow formulation. See [OPFLOW](opflow.md). The last equation is the coupling between the 2nd stage contingency scenarios and the first-stage. Each contingency scenario can either be single-period or multi-period. In the multi-period mode, additional data files for the load and wind generation profiles can be set via command line options. Multi-period SCOPFLOW is activated either by setting command line option `-scopflow_enable_multiperiod` OR calling `SCOPFLOWEnableMultiPeriod`.

Depending on the `mode`, SCOPFLOW can either be `preventive` (mode = 0) or `corrective` (mode = 1). In the preventive, the PV and PQ generator real power is fixed to its correspoinding base-case values. Any power offset/make-up is done by the swing bus generators. The corrective mode allows deviation of the PV and PQ generator real power from the base-case dispatch constrained by its 30-min. ramp rate capability.


### Usage
SCOPFLOW is executed via
```
mpiexec -n <N> ./scopflow <options>
```
where \<options\> are the available command line options as given in the next section.

### Options
The current version has several options available for SCOPFLOW. These options can be either set through the options file `options/scopflowoptions` or via the command line.

#### Network file (-netfile <netfilename>): 
Set the name of the network file. Only MATPOWER format is currently supported. 4096 characters max.

```
mpiexec -n <N> ./scopflow -netfile <netfilename>
```

#### Contingency file (-ctgcfile <ctgcfilename>): 
Set the name of the contingency data file. The contingency scenarios are set through this file. 4096 characters max.
```
mpiexec -n <N> ./scopflow -netfile <netfilename> -ctgcfile <ctgcfilename>
```
Contingencies can either be specified in PTI format (.con file) or a native format. The description of the native format is given in the header file `include/scopflow.h`. SCOPFLOW supports single/multiple generator and line/transformer outage contingencies.

#### Solver (-scopflow_solver <IPOPT,HIOP,EMPAR>)
Set the solver to be used for SCOPFLOW. With IPOPT, SCOPFLOW can be only run on one processor (N = 1) as IPOPT only supports single process execution. HIOP supports a distributed solution allowing SCOPFLOW to be solved in parallel. In addition, one can solve SCOPFLOW in an embarrasingly parallel model with the EMPAR solver. With EMPAR, the base case and the contingencies are solved independently, i.e, there is no coupling.
```
mpiexec -n <N> ./scopflow -netfile <netfilename> -ctgcfile <ctgcfilename> -scopflow_solver <IPOPT>
```
#### Mode (-scopflow_mode <0 or 1>)
Set SCOPFLOW to either run in `preventive` (0) or `corrective` (1) mode. In preventive mode, the base-case and contingency real-power dispatch is equal for the PV and PQ generators. In the corrective mode, the contingency real-power dispatch for these generators is allowed to deviate from the base-case limited by its 30-min ramping limit. 
```
mpiexec -n <N> ./scopflow -netfile <netfilename> -ctgcfile <ctgcfilename> -scopflow_mode <0 or 1>
```

#### Number of contingencies (-scopflow_Nc <Nc>): 
Sets the number of contingencies. This should be less than or equal to the number of contingencies set in the contingency file.

```
./scopflow -netfile <netfilename> -ctgcfile <ctgcfilename> -scopflow_Nc <Nc>
```

With this option set, SCOPFLOW will only pick up the first Nc contingencies in the contingency file. To select all contingencies, use `Nc = -1`

#### Enable multi-period [Only for multi-period SCOPFLOW] (-scopflow_enable_multiperiod <0 or 1>)
Disable/Enable multiperiod SCOPFLOW (disabled by default)

#### Duration [Only for multi-period SCOPFLOW] (-scopflow_duration <duration>)
The duration for the multi-period SCOFLOW in hours.

#### Time-step [Only for multi-period SCOPFLOW] (-scopflow_dT <dT>)
The time-step for multi-period SCOPFFLOW in minutes.

#### Active power load profile [Only for multi-period SCOPFLOW] (-scopflow_ploadprofile <ploadprofile_filename>)
The name of the file describing the active load profile. See `$EXAGO_DIR/datafiles/case9/load_P.csv` for the format.

#### Reactive power load profile [Only for multi-period SCOPFLOW] (-scopflow_qloadprofile <qloadprofile_filename>)
The name of the file describing the reactive load profile. See `$EXAGO_DIR/datafiles/case9/load_Q.csv` for the format.

#### Wind generation profile [Only for multi-period SCOPFLOW] (-scopflow_windgenprofile <windgenprofile_filename>)
The name of the file describing the wind generation profile. See `$EXAGO_DIR/datafiles/case9/scenarios.csv` for the format.

#### OPFLOW model (-opflow_model <modelname>)
This is an option inherited from [OPFLOW](opflow.md). It sets the model (representation of variables and equations) to be used for SCOPFLOW. The default formulation is power balance form with polar representation for voltages
```
mpiexec -n <N> ./scopflow -netfile <netfilename> -ctgcfile <ctgcfilename> -opflow_model POWER_BALANCE_POLAR
```

All other OPFLOW options can be used with SCOPFLOW to select the appropriate model and parameter options.
