# <b>Exa</b>scale <b>G</b>rid <b>O</b>ptimization toolkit (ExaGO<sup>TM</sup>)
ExaGO<sup>TM</sup> is a package for solving large-scale power grid optimization problems on parallel and distributed architectures, particularly targeted for exascale machines with heteregenous architectures (GPU). It is written in C/C++ using the [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) library. An overview of the package is given on this page and the different links provided. For detailed information, including the different formulations used, see the [ExaGO manual](docs/manual/manual.pdf). 

ExaGO<sup>TM</sup> includes the following applications for solving different power grid optimization problems:

- [OPFLOW](docs/web/opflow.md) solves an AC optimal power flow either on CPU and GPU
- [TCOPFLOW](docs/web/tcopflow.md) solves a multi-period optimal power flow
- [SCOPFLOW](docs/web/scopflow.md) solves a multi-period security-constrained (contingency-constrained) optimal power
- [SOPFLOW](docs/web/sopflow.md) solves a stochastic security-constrained multi-period optimal power flow

ExaGO<sup>TM</sup> applications can use the following optimization packaages:

- [IPOPT](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt) is a popular optimization package for solving nonlinear optimization problems that uses an interior-point algorithm.
- [HiOp](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop) is a HPC package for optimization. ExaGO interfaces with two of its solvers -- a mixed sparse-dense interior-point solver (NewtonMDS) and a sparse interior-point solver (HiOPSparse). NewtonMDS  allows execution of the optimization either on CPU and GPU. The sparse HiOp solver is currently supported on CPU only.

Note that not all applications can utilize all solvers yet. The following table lists the solver-application compatibility.

|  Solver    | OPFLOW  | TCOPFLOW | SCOPLOW | SOPFLOW |
|:------:|:---------:|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|
| IPOPT      | Y         |  Y     | Y       | Y       | 
| HIOP       | Y          |       |   Y      |  Y       |

Note: The support for solving SCOPFLOW and SOPFLOW in parallel using the HiOP package is currently in development and is expected to be added in the next release.

## Installing

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) for information on acquiring, building and installing ExaGO.

## Usage
Instructions for executing the different ExaGO<sup>TM</sup> applications is given below.
- [OPFLOW](docs/web/opflow.md)
- [TCOPFLOW](docs/web/tcopflow.md)
- [SOPFLOW](docs/web/sopflow.md)
- [SCOPFLOW](docs/web/scopflow.md)
- [PFLOW](docs/web/pflow.md)

### Options

Each application has a different set of options that are described in depth in the usage notes. These options can be passed optionally through an options file (`-options_file <option_file>`), or directly on the command line.

Since options may be specified in more than one location (on the command line, and through an options file), it is worth noting that the option specified **last** is used. For example, if `opflowoptions` specified `-netfile case9mod.m`, the following behavior occurs:

```bash
# This uses case118.m
./opflow -options_file opflowoptions -netfile case118.m

# This uses case9mod.m
./opflow -netfile case118.m -options_file opflowoptions
```

Note that all ExaGO applications must run with an options file passed, and so if none is specified on the command line, ExaGO attempts to use the default application options in the `options` directory.
