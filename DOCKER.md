## PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
This example provides a base setup for using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).
More details on how to customize the installation and the compose file can be found [here (PostgreSQL)](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and [here (pgAdmin)](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/container_deployment.html).

## Configuration

### compose.yaml
Before deploying this setup, you shoud edit the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`. You also optionally change the username and email address.

## Deploy with docker compose
When deploying this setup, the pgAdmin web interface will be available at port 5050 (e.g. http://localhost:5050).  

``` shell
$ docker compose up
Starting postgres ... done
Starting pgadmin ... done
```

## Add postgres database to pgAdmin
After logging in with your credentials of the compose.yaml file, you can add your database to pgAdmin. 
1. Under Quick Links click Add New Server
2. Name your connection (anything works, I name it db)
3. Change to the "Connection" tab and add the connection details:
- Hostname: "postgres"
- Port: "5432"
- Maintenance Database: postgres
- Username: $POSTGRES_USER (see compose.yaml)
- Password: $POSTGRES_PW (see compose.yaml)
  
## Expected result

Check containers are running:
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                                                                                  NAMES
849c5f48f784   postgres:latest                 "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   9 minutes ago       Up 9 minutes           0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp                                              postgres
d3cde3b455ee   dpage/pgadmin4:latest           "/entrypoint.sh"         9 minutes ago       Up 9 minutes           443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5050->80/tcp, :::5050->80/tcp                                         pgadmin
```

Stop the containers with
``` shell
$ docker compose down
# To delete all data run:
$ docker compose down -v
```
